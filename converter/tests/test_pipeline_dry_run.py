"""Pipeline dry-run test.

Runs the full pipeline in a temporary workspace with NO ROM present,
and checks that each stage reports the honest expected status:

  s00_detect       SKIPPED (no ROM in rom_input/)
  s01_extract      SKIPPED (no authenticated ROM)
  s02_decode       UNIMPLEMENTED (decoders are stubs)
  s03_normalise    UNIMPLEMENTED (nothing decoded)
  s04_map          UNIMPLEMENTED (nothing normalised)
  s05_emit         UNIMPLEMENTED (nothing mapped)
  s06_validate     SKIPPED (nothing emitted)
  s07_runtime      SKIPPED or UNIMPLEMENTED (no runtime harness wired)
  s08_report       PASS (always aggregates)

This test enforces that a fresh checkout, with no ROM and no runtime,
never produces a fake PASS on anything content-related.
